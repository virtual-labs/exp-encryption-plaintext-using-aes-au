      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. SubBytes is a non-linear substitution step that affects each byte individually.",
        "b": "Incorrect. ShiftRows is a transposition step that permutes bytes across rows.",
        "c": "Correct. MixColumns is a diffusion step that combines the bytes within each column.",
        "d": "Incorrect. AddRoundKey is a linear mixing step that combines the state with the round key."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the ShiftRows step in AES encryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To substitute bytes using the S-box",
        "b": "To permute the bytes within the state",
        "c": "To expand the key",
        "d": "To add the round key to the state"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Substitution using the S-box is performed in the SubBytes step.",
        "b": "Correct. ShiftRows permutes bytes within the state to ensure diffusion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Key expansion is not the purpose of ShiftRows; it is a separate process.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Adding the round key to the state is performed in the AddRoundKey step."
